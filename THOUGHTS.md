-   Assumptions should probably be checked for each separate model (not model with all data)

    -   If we are to compare the coefficients of each model then we need to be confident that the coefficients in each model are at least accurate

-   If we use full k6 data, we have 49 meth users (if we don't use k6 we have 50)

    -   Similar with non drug users, if we use it we have N = 71, if we don't we have 72

## Data to use3

### Must Have:

-   Full demographics (age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, education, employment, residential area, license status, ever used alcohol)

-   Full DDDI
