# Codebook & Data Dictionary

The following codebook contains information on scripts, individual variable names as well as calculations of specific assessments...

## Script & Analysis Information

While the analyses scripts (descriptives, multigroup-analyses and survey-analyses) can be run in any order, if running all code for the first time (or if an update has occurred in load-data or data-processing), load.data must be run before data-processing.

### load-packages.R

Loads and attaches all packages used in subsequent scripts and analyses.

Note: The package "Librarian" is used to load and attaches the relevant packages (as it will automatically install packages that are not currently installed). If Librarian is not already installed, running "load-packages" will automatically install Librarian before any other necessary packages.

### load-data.R

Does one of two things:

1.  If data has been updated and there are multiple survey files in the "data/" directory, it will take the most recent file and perform basic cleaning (adjusting column names) so that the data is in a data frame format. Once it has the raw data in a data frame, it moves the old file to an archive and saves the updated data as an object in `objects/survey-raw.RData`.
2.  If there has been no updates to the data since the last run of `load-data.R`, it will load the current data located in `objects/survey.raw.RData`

### data-processing.R

### descriptives.R

-   Runs descriptive analysis on data.

-   Descriptive summaries are saved as 'summ.'

### output-prep.R

-   Prepares the output in relevant format (primary ggplots and flextables) to either then be exported or used in quarto document
